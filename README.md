# Abbey Starter Kit Databricks

This example shows how to create a Grant Kit.
The example features requesting access to a [Databricks Group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs/resources/group)
from multiple reviewers, requiring only `one_of` the reviewers to approve the access.
Access is automatically revoked after 3 days.

## Usage
